# pcm-encoder-and-decoder
The MATLAB code provided encodes a sine wave signal of a particular frequency to a given sampling frequency and is quantized based on number of bits that used to quantize.

All the basic parameters like Signal frequency, sampling frequency, number of quantization levels can be easily chnaged according to the problem.
